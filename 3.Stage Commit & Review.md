# 📘 Tutorial: Stage, Commit, and Review Changes Effectively in Git

---

## 1. Introduction

When working with Git, you’ll spend most of your time **making changes, saving them, and reviewing your history**.

Three key steps you need to master are:

1. **Stage changes** → Selecting which files (or parts of files) you want to include in your next snapshot.
2. **Commit changes** → Taking a snapshot of the project and recording it with a message.
3. **Review changes** → Looking at what you’ve done and what others have done in the past.

Think of it like taking photos:

* **Staging** = choosing what to include in the photo (pose, angle).
* **Commit** = actually snapping the photo.
* **Review** = looking at the photo album later.

Let’s go step by step.

## 2. Understanding the Workflow

Here’s a quick overview of how Git handles changes:

1. **Working Directory** → Where you edit your files.
2. **Staging Area** → A waiting room where you collect changes before committing.
3. **Repository (History)** → Where commits are permanently saved.

Flow:
👉 Edit files → Stage files → Commit → Review history

## 3. Stage Changes

### What is Staging?

When you edit files, Git doesn’t automatically save them. You must **stage** them first to tell Git, *“These are the changes I want to commit.”*

### Common Commands

* Stage a single file:

  ```bash
  git add file1.txt
  ```

* Stage multiple files:

  ```bash
  git add file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

* Stage all changes in the project:

  ```bash
  git add .
  ```

* Stage only part of a file (interactive):

  ```bash
  git add -p
  ```

  This lets you choose which lines to stage. Very useful when you want to commit only part of your edits.

💡 **Tip:** Don’t always stage everything blindly. Stage only meaningful changes that belong together. This keeps your history clean.

## 4. Commit Changes

### What is a Commit?

A **commit** is like a snapshot of your project at a specific time. It contains:

* The changes you staged.
* The author’s name.
* A timestamp.
* A **commit message** (explaining the change).

### How to Commit

After staging:

```bash
git commit -m "Added introduction section to README"
```

### Best Practices for Commit Messages

* Keep them **short and clear** (ideally under 50 characters for the first line).
* Use the present tense:

  * ✅ “Fix login bug”
  * ❌ “Fixed login bug”
* Optionally, write a longer description if needed:

  ```bash
  git commit
  ```

  This opens an editor where you can write:

  ```
  Add login validation

  - Added email format check
  - Prevents empty passwords
  - Shows error messages for invalid inputs
  ```

💡 **Tip:** Good commit messages make your project history readable, even months or years later.

## 5. Review Changes

### Before Committing

Check what you’ve changed but not yet staged:

```bash
git status
```

See the actual changes (diff):

```bash
git diff
```

Check staged changes (what will be committed):

```bash
git diff --cached
```

---

### After Committing

View commit history:

```bash
git log
```

Cleaner history (one line per commit):

```bash
git log --oneline
```

See who changed which lines in a file:

```bash
git blame file.txt
```

Show detailed history with branches:

```bash
git log --graph --oneline --all
```

---

## 6. Putting It All Together (Example)

Let’s walk through a scenario.

1. You create a file:

   ```bash
   echo "Hello Git" > hello.txt
   ```

2. Check status:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   Output: `Untracked file: hello.txt`

3. Stage the file:

   ```bash
   git add hello.txt
   ```

4. Commit with a message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add hello.txt with greeting message"
   ```

5. Make another change:

   ```bash
   echo "This is a Git tutorial" >> hello.txt
   ```

6. Review changes before staging:

   ```bash
   git diff
   ```

7. Stage and commit again:

   ```bash
   git add hello.txt
   git commit -m "Append tutorial line to hello.txt"
   ```

8. Review history:

   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

Output might look like:

```
2f3b9d2 Append tutorial line to hello.txt
1a2b3c4 Add hello.txt with greeting message
```

🎉 Now you’ve staged, committed, and reviewed changes effectively!

## 7. Tips for Effective Workflow

* **Commit often, but not too often.** Each commit should represent one logical change.
* **Review before committing.** Always check `git diff` or `git status`.
* **Write clear commit messages.** Imagine someone else (or future you) reading it months later.
* **Group related changes together.** Don’t mix unrelated edits in the same commit.
* **Use branches** for bigger features—keeps main history clean.

---

## 8. Summary

* **Stage**: Decide what changes to include (`git add`).
* **Commit**: Take a snapshot with a meaningful message (`git commit -m`).
* **Review**: Check changes before (`git status`, `git diff`) and after (`git log`, `git diff --cached`).

By following these steps carefully, you’ll keep your project history clean, understandable, and easy to maintain.

👉 Once you master staging, committing, and reviewing, you’re ready to collaborate with others (pushing, pulling, and merging).
